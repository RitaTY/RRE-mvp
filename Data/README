The comprehensive all-aspects accuracy audit comparing Ritas ground truth labels with Gemini Flash Lites predictions.

Two labeled datasets are analzyed, RRE_Blind_Test_Set_Rita and RRE_Blind_Test_Set_Geimini_2. 

Each review may contain more than one Aspect. 
To calculate the accuracy of Human against AI model, we use F1 Score.  
Firstly,  Recall (What % of human aspect did Geimini Flash Lite catch) is calcuated? 
Secondly, Precision: What % of Gemini aspects are correct (match Rita)?
Then, F1 score is calculated by the formuula.

The results show that: 
F1- Score is 62.35%, lower than the acceptable benchmark. 

Out of 164 aspects Rita labeled:
✅ 101 correctly identified (True Positives)
❌ 63 completely missed (False Negatives)
⚠️ 59 hallucinated (False Positives - aspects Gemini made up)

Major findings: 
1. Missing Critical Aspects (63 misses)
Instructions/UX - Gemini often misses use case discussions
Value/Price - Misses return/regret signals
Color/Aesthetics - Confuses appearance with quality

2. Hallucinating Aspects (59 false alarms)
Adds Sizing/Fit when only Comfort is mentioned
Adds Material/Quality when discussing Shipping
Over-labels common aspects, under-labels rare ones

3. Aspect Confusion
Confuses Color/Aesthetics with Material/Quality (10 times)
Confuses Value/Price with Material/Quality
Confuses Instructions/UX with Sizing/Fit

Suggestion: 
Option A: Improve Prompts (Try First - Cheapest)

Add explicit aspect examples
Clarify confusing categories
Re-test on 20 reviews → if better, re-run audit

Option B: Upgrade Model
Try Gemini Flash Standard (not Lite)
Cost: 2-3x higher, but may hit 80%
